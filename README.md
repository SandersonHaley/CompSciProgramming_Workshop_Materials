# CompSciProgramming_Workshop_Materials
Draft material from the first Computer Science and Programming Workshop held at VIDO March-June 2023  

This includes all the scripts for the workshop but not the practice material for the linux and python tutorials as that was data from a currently unpublished manuscripts.
Once, the publication is accepted I will add the material that goes with the workshops. 

There are still typos which will be corrected with the next offering of the workshop.
